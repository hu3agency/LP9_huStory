### The polymathProtocol

The Polymath Protocol is an open source heart-brain training framework for creating an ourStory game. Below are the steps documenting how to create and contribute to each of the 9 dimensions of ep0_2020Vision.

# b0mission

### gr0v0ego

Our __language__ institution is allowing __fear__ to contribute to the universal challenge of __polarization__. ep0_lessonPlan by lp0_polymathProcess will learn from __A New Earth__ by __Eckhart Tolle__ to help deepen our understanding of our collective ego.

### gr0v1biomimicry

__Water__ use __polarization__ to create __strong bonds__. ep0_lessonPlan by lp0_polymathProcess will learn from __The Tao Te Ching__ by __Lao Tzu__ to explore biomimetic perspectives for our challenges.

### gr0v2willpower

lp0_polymathProcess is developing an open source game that learns from __water__ so we can create __strong bonds__ with __polarization__. We will learn from __The Polymath__ by __Waqas Ahmed__ to help define how we operate.
