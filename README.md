The School of Bitcoin Open Curriculum is based on the open source content framework developed by hu3agency. By completing the steps below, students will create a nine section learning strategy set to a playlist of nine of their favorite songs. Each section takes in inputs from the curriculum creator to generate a hash value.

## b0mission
With b0mission, you use music and book quotes to define the foundation of the language & mission for your open source curriculum. The b0mission hash function takes four variables: `gr0v0song`, `gr0v1ego`, `gr0v2biomimicry`, and `gr0v3willpower`.
```
let b0mission = SHA256(gr0ourSource);

let gr0ourSource = {
  longPlay:        "LP_NAME",
  epicPlaylist:    "EP_Name",
  gr0v0song:       "SONG_NAME by ARTIST",
  gr0v1ego:        "BOOK_TITLE by AUTHOR",
  gr0v2biomimicry: "BOOK_TITLE by AUTHOR",
  gr0v3willpower:  "BOOK_TITLE by AUTHOR"
};

```
## b1community
With b1community, you use music and memes to define what the community of students who take this curriculum will create together. The b1community hash function takes four variables: `gr1v0song`, `gr1v1decentralization`, `gr1v2space`, and `gr1v3time`.
```
let b1community = SHA256(gr1ourJourney);
